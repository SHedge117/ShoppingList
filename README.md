## Introduction
This iOS app allows users to create and view shopping lists. 

## Shopping List Table
The initial screen will show the shopping lists that the user has created and show how many items are contained in each one. The picture above shows the lists as being two different stores, but the lists can be anything the user wants. Clicking the + button will allow the user to create a new list. Tapping on one that is already created will bring them to that lists contents.

## Shopping List
After clicking + or tapping on a shopping list, the screen will display the contents of that list. When creating a brand new list this will be empty and the user can type the name of the list in a text box at the top. From that screen the user can press the + button at the top right to add a new item or click the back button to return to the previous screen

## Item Creation
The item creation screen will bring the user to three text boxes where they can type in the name, amount and price of the item they want to shop for. The amount and price is not required. For example, the user can type the name as "Sour Cream", amount as "8oz" and leave the price empty. When using the back button to return to the list, that item will be added to the shopping list.
